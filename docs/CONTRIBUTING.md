# Contributing

## Choosing an issue

_If you do know what you want to contributeâ€¦_
Create an issue using a template:
- Feature: if you want to implement something new.
- Bug: if you want to fix something broken.
ðŸ’¡TIP: Get feedback from the core maintainers and / or community before jumping into code.

_If you donâ€™t know what you want to contributeâ€¦_
Look at the open [issues](https://github.com/React-Vancouver/website/issues). If you are just starting out, look for _good first issue_ tags. Comment on the issue to discuss the implementation plan or reach out to core maintainers on Slack.

## Get the code
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies with  `yarn`
3. `yarn start` for Gatsby

## Working on issues
1. Create a new branch for your work:
  1.1 off `project` branch if you are contributing to a larger project,
  1.2 off `production` if you are contributing an individual feature or fix.
2. The naming convention for branches is `[feature|fix]/[issue-number]/[issue-name]` (eg `feature/3/add-readme`)

## Pull Request Process
You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

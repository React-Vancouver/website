# React Vancouver | Website

### What is ReactVancouver?

ReactVancouver is a monthly gathering of front end engineers and designers of all levels, from boot camp grads to super senior. Every month, we provide 2~3 short educational and informative talks about React and social time with other developers, recruiters, and tech enthusiasts.

If youâ€™re a developer who wants to learn more about React or looking for a job, a recruiter who wants to find talent, or an entrepreneur who wishes to connect with new peopleâ€”Youâ€™re in the right place.

Live website is at [reactvancouver.com](https://reactvancouver.com/). âš  This project is currently under development. âš
